		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>New York University (NYU) offers its faculty and students a campus-wide transportation network via buses on scheduled routes during the day and an on-demand van at night. Realtime vehicle  positions  can  be  viewed  on  a  website  and  in  mobile  apps  for  Apple  iOS  and  Android operating systems. Static schedules are posted online as well.<!-- Seemingly unavailable, however, is a software that provides directions via the campus transportation network. --></p>
		<p>It has been a consensus among the team members that NYU’s buses are a useful and necessary service that can connect an otherwise very divided campus. Unfortunately, it seems to be the case that NYU’s online bus schedule does not provide an intuitive enough method to allow people to travel from place to place. With it, the user must manually look through the bus schedule for each day and time. If the destination is not simple to get to, the user must try to mentally calculate: which bus goes to what stop, where to transfer from that bus, and what time to leave by. As users of this service, we have found it too irritating to try and use the bus service. Meanwhile, there are dozens of apps that can direct the user through to which trains to travel by or which public buses to take. To fully be able to utilize the services we are given (and paying indirectly for through our tuition) we wanted something to simplify travelling through NYU, and that is what NYU Campus Transportation Itinerary Planner or NYU CTIP (pronounced “enwīyü sētip”) can do for us. It can make travelling within the NYU campus as easy as travelling by subway (and saving the $2.75 we must pay every day to get to class).</p>
		<!-- <p>While  existing  software  products  make  the  navigation  of  the  New  York  City  Subway, P.A.T.H. train, NJ Transit rail and bus, Long Island Railroad, Metro-North Railroad, Staten Island Ferry, Citi Bike, Uber, and Lyft very simple, there is no equivalent for the campus transportation network; members of the NYU community must manually plan their trips. This is where the NYU Campus Transportation Itinerary Planner or NYU CTIP (pronounced “enwīyü sētip”) comes in.</p> -->
		<p>NYU CTIP is a software system that guides users through the campus transportation network at New York University. <!--Although software that makes the use of other forms of public transportation simple, --> While  existing  software  products  make  the  navigation  of  the  New  York  City  Subway, P.A.T.H. train, NJ Transit rail and bus, Long Island Railroad, Metro-North Railroad, Staten Island Ferry, Citi Bike, Uber, and Lyft very simple, no software that provides directions via the campus transportation network exists, and this software aims to satisfy that need by providing an automated approach to navigating the network directly on the user’s personal device.</p>
